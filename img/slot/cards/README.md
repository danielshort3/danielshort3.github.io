This folder holds icon images for VIP cards organized by tier name.
Add your own images under the `basic/`, `fine/`, `rare/`, `epic/`, `elite/`, `mythic/` and `divine/`
subfolders and update `src/modules/cardData.js` to reference them instead
of the `assets/placeholder.png` path.

**Task:** Upload icon art for the Divine tier cards into `assets/vip_cards/divine`.
Each file should match the card names defined in `src/modules/cardData.js` (for example
`vip_eternal_fortune.png`).

All placeholder and custom VIP card images must be **1024×1024** pixels.
